============

**Hi! My name is Brian Hsu. I am a Master's student at Northwestern University studying Statistics and Data Science. I am interested in developing embodied agents through generative AI and other deep learning techniques.**

**I have experience in deep learning, generative models (large language models + diffusion models), and reinforcement learning.**

**My background is Statistics + Biology + Coding.** 

Current Research: 
====================
### 1. Argonne National Laboratory - Embodied AI ðŸ¤– + Self-Driving Labs ðŸ§¬:

* The goal of my research at ANL is to develop LLM-driven embodied agents for scientific workflows. Specifically, I use LLMs to develop embodied agents with reasoning and control, and mount them on virtual and robotic platforms that will automate biology experiments. I work under the Ramanathan Lab as well as the Rapid Prototyping Lab at Argonne to make this possible!

### 2. Northwestern University - Generative AI ðŸ¤– + Reinforcement Learning Robotics ðŸ¦¾: 


## Potential applications for my research include: 
1.) Self-Driving Labs 
2.)
