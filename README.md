# Brian Hsu

Hi, my name is Brian Hsu. I am a Masters student at Northwestern University studying Statistics and Data Science. My primary interests are in harnessing generative AI and deep learning techniques to develop embodied agent AI. Currently, my research is focused into two projects: 

## My Current Research Jobs: 
### Argonne National Laboratory Research - Large Language Models and Embodied Agents for Self-Driving Labs:

* The goal of my research at ANL is to develop LLM-driven embodied agents for scientific workflows. Specifically, I use LLMs to develop embodied agents with reasoning and control, and mount them on virtual and robotic platforms that will automate biology experiments. I work under the Ramanathan Lab as well as the Rapid Prototyping Lab at Argonne to make this possible!

### Northwestern University Research - Large Language Models and Diffusion Models for Robust Reinforcement Learning Agents: 


## Potential applications for my research include: 
1.) Self-Driving Labs 
2.) 

## Side Projects:
